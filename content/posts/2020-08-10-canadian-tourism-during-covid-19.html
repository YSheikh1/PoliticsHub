<p>Canadians love to go places. In fact, we spend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1EtusMMazc">$36 billion outside the country pursuing a good vacation.</a> Tourism within Canada is, also, a booming business. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/pandemic-aftermath-what-s-happening-to-tourism-and-covid-driven-car-habits-in-canada-1.5628326/how-canada-s-tourism-industry-is-trying-to-salvage-summer-2020-1.5630486">According to Industry Associations</a>, the tourism business in Canada generates over $100 billion, and provides 1.8 million jobs. These jobs account for 10% of all the jobs in Canada.</p>
<p>However, due to recent measures taken place in order to combat COVID-19, the tourism business has taken a big hit. <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7020442/tourism-canada-coronavirus/">42% of businesses in the accommodation and food sectors have reported a revenue drops of more than 50% according to an April survey of 12,600 businesses. Also in April, the unemployment rate in the industry rose to 28%.</a></p>

It is estimated that 2 out of 3 restaurants will go bankrupt within Canada if they are not financed correctly. The letter states “Like you, we believe personal safety is critical. However, many of the travel restrictions currently in place are simply too broad or unnecessary.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/pandemic-aftermath-what-s-happening-to-tourism-and-covid-driven-car-habits-in-canada-1.5628326/how-canada-s-tourism-industry-is-trying-to-salvage-summer-2020-1.5630486">“If Canada does not reopen any time soon, the danger is that the summer season will go by fast and operators, suppliers will not be able to to make any money in the summer.”</a> said Frederick Dimanche, director of the Ted Rogers School of Hospitality and Tourism Management at Ryerson University. The summer season is the time of year that tourism makes most of its revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7020442/tourism-canada-coronavirus/">This is why the Canadian government</a> has decided to allocate $30 million to give to these businesses so they are able to promote the idea of “exploring your own backyards” to Canadians across the country. In P.E.I, Matthew MacKay (P.E.I’s legislative representative) said that the province is advertising “staycations” to its residents in order to support homegrown business.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, is when Canadians should explore our country. If Canadians spent half the amount they spend outside the country on travelling within, it could completely save the tourism industry. The exploration could take place all over the country: in one of the territories, a neighbouring province, taking a 2 hour drive in any direction, or going a couple blocks down the road from our residences. Our own Canadian businesses are in need of serious help, and Canadians are the only people capable of providing that assistance.</p>
<p>We all need to become active participants in our own society, support local businesses while taking the appropriate precautions to protect ourselves and others from COVID-19. We live in one of the most beautiful countries in the world, and now is the time when we all need to appreciate that beauty.</p>
