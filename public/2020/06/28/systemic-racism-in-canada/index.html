<p>155 years ago, slavery was abolished in the United States. 57 years ago, Martin Luther King Jr delivered his famous “I have a dream” speech and the following year President Lynden B. Johnson abolished segregation within the United States.</p>
<p>Today, the barbaric treatment of coloured people, specifically black people, in the United States has seemed to have carried through. With obvious acts of racism within the general population, such as the lynching of Ahmaud Arbery, and systemic racism within the law enforcement and government, such as the murder of George Floyd and multiple statements made by President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>With the increased attention given to systemic racism and the obvious signs that it exists in today’s world, other countries have been forced to check themselves, most notably the United States’ neighbour, Canada.</p>
<p>According to Leger360, which conducted a survey for the Association for Canadian Studies, 50% of Canadians said they thought racism was a very or somewhat serious problem in law enforcement, while 72% supported those protesting in the streets in the United States. A survey by Abacus Data for CityNews found that 61% of Canadians were certain or pretty certain that that there is systemic or institutional racism in Canada, only 9% said that there probably or definitely isn’t.</p>
<p>Black parliamentarians within Canada, as well as allied parties, have signed on a declaration demanding the government take immediate action in order to eradicate racism. This declaration comes after the black Canadian community issued a statement saying “The Afro-Canadian community has spoken for many years and is no longer interested in continued consultation and study,” which was signed off by the caucus on June 15th 2020. This statement comes several days after negotiations and consultations between black parliamentarians and the black Canadian community on what steps the government should take to fight racism.</p>
<p>The caucus also asked the government to consider making a justice plan using the advice of black Canadians who have experienced unfair police treatment.</p>
<p>As tensions about civil rights, specifically black people’s civil rights, a number of highly ranked Canadian officials, premiers, columnists, and the head of the RCMP, issued statements about the situation. However their statements seemed to create doubt about systemic racism actually being in Canada, rather than addressing the situation at hand. Ontario premier, Doug Ford, stated “Thank God we’re different than the United States and we don’t have the systemic, deep roots of racism they’ve had for years.” which was echoed in a statement issued by the Quebec premier, Francois Legault. RCMP commissioner, Brenda Lucki, stated “As many have said, I do know that systemic racism is part of every institution, the RCMP included. Throughout our history and today, we have not always treated racialized and Indigenous people fairly.” backtracking on an earlier statement where she denied systematic racism existed in the RCMP.</p>
<p>Elections are a major event that will be affected by the events of recent times. Due to COVID-19, daily life has been drastically altered in order to commit to safety and keeping everybody as healthy as possible. With this crisis, the popularity for the Liberal government has gone up as the general population is impressed with how they are dealing with the situation. But with the murder of George Floyd, people are calling for social and institutional reform, and the different parties’ stance on this subject can easily swing votes. According to statistics found by Abacus data, the Liberals have the support of 52% of coloured Canadians, compared to 22% for the Conservatives and 20% for the NDP. However, in data found from Leger, NDP supporters seem to care more deeply about racism than other parties. Leger found that 64% of New Democrat voters think that racism is a serious problem in law enforcement, compared to 59% of Liberal voters, and only 31% for Conservatives.</p>
